# My Journey of Learning HTML and CSS

This is a documentation of my journey of learning HTML and CSS. As a beginner, I started by learning the basics of HTML, such as the structure of an HTML document, tags, attributes, and elements. I practiced creating various HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, and tables.

After getting comfortable with HTML, I moved on to learning CSS, which allowed me to style and layout my HTML content. I learned about selectors, properties, values, and how to use them to add colors, fonts, layouts, and animations to my HTML elements. I also practiced using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to create responsive and modern-looking websites.

Throughout my learning journey, I encountered various challenges and obstacles, but I persisted and learned from them. I also used online resources like W3Schools, pin code , and Stack Overflow to supplement my learning. By the end of my journey, I was able to create my own website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

I hope that by sharing my journey, I can inspire and encourage others who are also learning HTML and CSS. Remember, learning is a process, and it's okay to make mistakes and ask for help. Keep practicing and never give up!
